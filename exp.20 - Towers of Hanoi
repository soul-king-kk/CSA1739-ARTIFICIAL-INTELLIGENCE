% Define the predicate hanoi/3
% hanoi(N, Source, Target) is true if we can move N discs from the source tower to the target tower

hanoi(1, Source, Target, _) :-
    write('Move top disk from '),
    write(Source),
    write(' to '),
    write(Target),
    nl.

hanoi(N, Source, Target, Auxiliary) :-
    N > 1,
    M is N - 1,
    hanoi(M, Source, Auxiliary, Target),
    hanoi(1, Source, Target, _),
    hanoi(M, Auxiliary, Target, Source).

% Example usage:
% To solve the Towers of Hanoi problem with 3 discs:
% ?- hanoi(3, 'A', 'C', 'B').
